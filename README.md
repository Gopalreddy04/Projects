## Description
This project involves predicting the stock price of Netflix using historical stock data. The goal is to build a predictive model that can forecast future stock prices based on past trends.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-Learn
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## Dataset
- Historical stock price data of Netflix (can be sourced from Yahoo Finance or similar)

## Key Features
- Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, feature scaling, etc.
- Model Building: Implementing regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor)
- Evaluation: Metrics such as RMSE, MAE, etc.
- Visualization: Plotting predicted vs. actual prices

## Installation
1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository-url>`
2. Install the required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the Jupyter notebook: `jupyter notebook`

## Usage
- Open the Jupyter notebook and run the cells to see the results and visualizations.

## Description
This project focuses on classifying music tracks into different genres using machine learning techniques. The aim is to build a model that can accurately predict the genre of a given track based on its features.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-Learn
- Librosa
- TensorFlow/Keras (if applicable)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Dataset
- Music dataset containing audio features and genre labels (e.g., GTZAN dataset)

## Key Features
- Data Preprocessing: Feature extraction from audio files, normalization
- Model Building: Implementing classification models (e.g., SVM, Random Forest, Neural Networks)
- Evaluation: Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score
- Visualization: Confusion matrix, classification reports

## Installation
1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository-url>`
2. Install the required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the Jupyter notebook: `jupyter notebook`

## Usage
- Open the Jupyter notebook and execute the cells to see the results and evaluations.
