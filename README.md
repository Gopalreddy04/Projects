## Netflix Stock Price Prediction

**Project Title**: Netflix Stock Price Prediction

**Description**: This project involves predicting the stock price of Netflix using historical stock data. The goal is to build a predictive model that can forecast future stock prices based on past trends.

**Technologies Used:**

Python
Pandas
NumPy
Scikit-Learn
Matplotlib
Jupyter Notebook
Dataset:

Historical stock price data of Netflix (can be sourced from Yahoo Finance or similar)
Key Features:

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, feature scaling, etc.
Model Building: Implementing regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor)
Evaluation: Metrics such as RMSE, MAE, etc.
Visualization: Plotting predicted vs. actual prices
Installation:


Run the Jupyter notebook: jupyter notebook

**Usage:**

Open the Jupyter notebook and run the cells to see the results and visualizations.

## Music Genre Classification
**Project Title:** Music Genre Classification

**Description:** 

This project focuses on classifying music tracks into different genres using machine learning techniques. The aim is to build a model that can accurately predict the genre of a given track based on its features.

**Technologies Used:**

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Scikit-Learn

Librosa

TensorFlow/Keras (if applicable)

Jupyter Notebook

**Dataset:**

Music dataset containing audio features and genre labels (e.g., GTZAN dataset)

**Key Features:**

**Data Preprocessing:** 

Feature extraction from audio files, normalization
Model Building: Implementing classification models (e.g., SVM, Random Forest, Neural Networks)

**Evaluation:**

 Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score

**Visualization:**

Confusion matrix, classification reports
Installation:

Run the Jupyter notebook: jupyter notebook

**Usage:**

Open the Jupyter notebook and execute the cells to see the results and evaluations.
